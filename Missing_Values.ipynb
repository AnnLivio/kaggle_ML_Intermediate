As an extreme example, consider a dataset with 10,000 rows, where one important column is missing a single entry. This approach would drop the column entirely!\n",

        "### 2) A Better Option: Imputation\n",
        "\n",
        "**Imputation** fills in the missing values with some number.  For instance, we can fill in the mean value along each column.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3) An Extension To Imputation\n",
        "\n",
        "Imputation is the standard approach, and it usually works well. However, imputed values may be systematically above or below their actual values (which weren't collected in the dataset). Or rows with missing values may be unique in some other way. In that case, your model would make better predictions by considering which values were originally missing.  \n",

        "\n",
        "In some cases, this will meaningfully improve results. In other cases, it doesn't help at all.\n",

        "\n",
